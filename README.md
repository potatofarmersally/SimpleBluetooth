# SimpleBluetooth

## This is an app similar to a "Hello World" introduction for Bluetooth. 
Functionality speaking, it's supposed to display a message saying "Device connected" when the Bluetooth device is connected and "Device not connected" when the device is disconnected. 

## Right now
Right now it only connects to a speaker and that's when it displays the message, but in the future I hope for it to connect to other devices and have it display the same message.
